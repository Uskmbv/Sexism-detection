# Sexism-detection
This project was completed by Altyn Uskembayeva and Kelvin Zifla
As a part of text classification task, sexism detection is a relevant solution for a big problem that is happening all over the world. 
This particular project focuses on the English language and uses the sexism_reddit dataset. Not only were we able to teach our 3 models to distinguish between sexist and non-sexist texts, but also what type of sexism was implied. 
The amount of models: 3. Baseline model (Logistic regression), 2 transformer models (DistilBERT and RoBERTa).
